# Robotic Chess

This repository holds a simple project to control a robotic arm to play a game of chess.

It uses a Python software to run a chess engine and send commands to an ESP32 microcontroller, which then moves a robotic arm with the help of a custom designed PCB.

The `design` folder contains the necessary files for manufacturing the control PCB.  
The `firmware` folder contains the firmware used on the ESP32.  
The `report` folder contains the full report made for this project (in Portuguese).  
The `software` folder contains the Python script used to run the engine.  
The `tools` folder contains some additional tools and files created for this project.
